# I am a Software Engineer

![mouse and keyboard on a desk](/img/keyboard.png)

I am a Software Engineer who is driven by a passion for learning and applying new technologies in innovative ways. Through my work, I strive to build clear and simple solutions to challenging problems in cloud computing, systems programming, and computer graphics. I have designed and built software systems that provide value for organizations ranging from small start-up teams to some of the worldâ€™s largest enterprise businesses.

## Microsoft

I work professionally as a Senior Software Engineer on Microsoft's [Industry Solutions Engineering (ISE)](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/ISE/) team where I help solve the toughest technical challenges that companies are facing in the modern Cloud Computing landscape.

## Background

I got my start in software like many others, wanting to make games. This lead me to learn a ton about computer graphics programming as well as various platforms for developing applications including cross-platform game engines, mobile apps, and web dev.

While in school, I was fortunate enough to be part of the [Worldspinner](https://worldspinner.com/) team where I developed a variety of tools to empower creatives to build people, cultures, and worlds for their games and stories. At Worldspinner, I played a big role in mobile platform integration and graphics development for the [PortraitWorks](https://worldspinner.com/portraits.html) mobile app.

# And Some Personal Stuff

I am fortunate enough to work a fully-remote job in Sonoma County, CA where I was born and raised. I live with my dog, Hughie, and enjoy travel when my job and life allows.

My hobby is collecting hobbies. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, gaming, cooking, skiing, speed cubing, building keyboards, and music.
