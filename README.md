## Development

This site is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and [tabi](https://welpo.github.io/tabi/). It was forked from [tabi-start](https://github.com/welpo/tabi-start).

```sh
# Install Zola
brew install zola

# Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/axis7818/axis7818.github.io
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Start Developing
zola serve
```

## Publishing Updates

Changes pushed to the `main` branch of the GitHub repository are published to the public site. The static assets are built with the [build-and-deploy.yml](.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml) GitHub Actions workflow and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) hosts assets in the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/axis7818/axis7818.github.io/tree/gh-pages) branch of the repository.
