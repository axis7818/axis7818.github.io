This feeling is nothing new to me, as making stuff is my primary motivator and I am drawn to new technologies like a moth to a flame. So, I did what I do best and decided to build an over-engineered tool to solve a minor problem: managing configuration and dotfiles on my development machines.<p>Over the course of a day, I use 3 different computers. My work MacBook, my personal MacBook, and my Windows gaming PC. On each of these computers, I install and configure the same set of software (ex: git, zsh, tmux). In order to synchronize configuration across machines, I set up a <a href=https://dotfiles.github.io>dotfiles repository</a>.<p>With <a href=https://github.com/axis7818/dotfiles>my dotfiles repository</a> cloned onto each of my computers, the problem became copying files to their expected filesystem location for the respective tools to use. This can be managed via scripts, but these scripts get tricky when files need to be slightly different for each machine. For example, on my work laptop, I want my gitconfig email address to be my work address rather than my personal one.<p>I used this problem as an excuse to learn <a href=https://www.rust-lang.org/>Rust</a> and build a CLI utility, <a href=https://github.com/axis7818/dotpatina>dotpatina</a>. Dotpatina allows me to <a href="https://github.com/axis7818/dotpatina?tab=readme-ov-file#patina-file">declaratively manage</a> dotfiles using <a href=https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/>handlebars templating</a> and renders <a href="https://github.com/axis7818/dotpatina?tab=readme-ov-file#applying-a-patina">diff visualizations</a> to make it clear what files need to change when I update my dotfiles repository.<p>Here is an example of it in action:<p><img alt="patina apply gif" src=/img/dotpatina/update-patina.gif><p>For more information about dotpatina, see the <a href=https://github.com/axis7818/dotpatina>GitHub repository</a>.<h1 id=being-a-beginner-again>Being a Beginner Again</h1><p>I chose Rust primarily because I have never used it before. And, its <a href=https://niklas-heer.github.io/speed-comparison/>performance</a> & <a href=https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3608324/us-and-international-partners-issue-recommendations-to-secure-software-products/>memory safety</a> guarantees sound like it would make a fun language for future projects.<p>My objective was to build a “production ready” (in quotes because I have no expectations that anyone other than me will use dotpatina) tool from the ground up using a new language and toolchain. I just wanted to be a beginner again, and Rust’s famously steep learning curve seemed like the perfect choice.<p><img alt="Rust learning curve" src=/img/dotpatina/rust_learning_curve.png><h2 id=beginner-rust-resources>Beginner Rust Resources</h2><p>Before really building anything, I started with the general Rust tutorials.<ol><li><a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/>rust by example</a>: Very good comprehensive language overview<li><a href=https://rustlings.cool/>rustlings</a>: Exercises to test Rust knowledge<li><a href=https://learnxinyminutes.com/rust/>Learn X in Y Minutes (Where X = Rust)</a>: My personal favorite website for getting familiar with a new language</ol><p>These were good introductions and served to introduce me to <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/why-cargo-exists.html>cargo</a>, Rust’s toolchain, and concepts (like <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/borrow.html>borrowing</a> and <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime.html>lifetimes</a>).<p>Compared to learning other programming languages, Rust has great resources for gaining hands-on practice right from the start. And, many of these resources guide you through error scenarios and how to fix them. Too often, introductory material will stop after the happy path where everything works as intended.<h2 id=the-rust-software-development-lifecycle>The Rust Software Development Lifecycle</h2><p>With Dotpatina, I didn’t just want to write the Rust code for a CLI. I wanted to write tests, publish it to a public place, and include documentation.<p>I used Rust and cargo for running tests and formatting. This was one of my favorite parts of the Rust language because of how consistent the tooling is across cargo crates.<p>The <a href=https://crates.io/crates/dotpatina>dotpatina create is published to crates.io</a> automatically when changes are <a href=https://github.com/axis7818/dotpatina/actions/workflows/continuous-deployment.yaml>pushed to main</a>.<p><a href=https://docs.rs/crate/dotpatina/latest>docs.rs</a> hosts documentation for any crates published to crates.io. But, I also included <a href=https://camerontaylor.dev/dotpatina/dotpatina/index.html>documentation hosting with GitHub pages</a>.<h3 id=vscode-vs-rust-rover>VSCode vs Rust Rover</h3><p>While building dotpatina, I also tested two development environments: <a href=https://code.visualstudio.com/>VSCode</a> with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer extension</a> and <a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/>RustRover by Jetbrains</a>.<p>Generally, I found Rust Rover to be the better experience for working directly with Rust code. It is easier to run Rust tests, cargo commands, and viewing Rust library documentation. However, the GitHub Copilot experience (details below) was better in VSCode.<h1 id=learning-rust-with-ai-assistance>Learning Rust with AI Assistance</h1><p>After learning the basics of Rust, but before diving into Rust development, I decided to make a conscious effort to use <a href=https://github.com/features/copilot>GitHub Copilot</a> (with the o1 preview model) as an AI programming assistant. This was my first honest effort using these tools on a “real” project. So, I will summarize what I thought about GitHub Copilot with tooling that I am not an expert in.<h2 id=explaining-errors>Explaining Errors</h2><p>My favorite use of GitHub Copilot is explaining errors. It doesn’t take long after starting a Rust program until running into your first compiler error. And, a regular part of working with Rust is dealing with the borrow checker. Since there are whole classes of compile time errors that would be runtime errors in traditional languages, it is very easy to provide error information as context to GitHub Copilot.<p>Before too long, I found myself defaulting to GitHub Copilot to explain an error. Invoking the <code>/explain</code> quick action is just a keyboard shortcut away, and is much quicker than copying relevant error information, searching the web, and finding a relevant (<a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76758400/cannot-return-value-referencing-local-variable-data-owned-by-current-function>probably Stack Overflow</a>) link.<p><img alt="Explain using Copilot tooltip" src=/img/dotpatina/explain-using-copilot-1.png><p>The GitHub Copilot chat view shows what portion of the code was referenced and explains a few potential solutions. In this case, returning values instead of references is the suggested solution.<p><img alt="Explain using Copilot response" src=/img/dotpatina/explain-using-copilot-2.png><p><strong>Except… the code is already doing that. And cloning doesn’t fix the error either.</strong><p><img alt="Updated code with clone" src=/img/dotpatina/explain-using-copilot-3.png><p><img alt="Copilot’s updated explanation" src=/img/dotpatina/explain-using-copilot-4.png><p><strong>So, why is this my favorite part of using GitHub Copilot?</strong><p>Well, because it helped me explore the error <strong>as it related to my code specifically</strong>. GitHub Copilot generally accounts for specifics to my codebase that are provided via context. When simply searching for error help online, the search results are independent of the code subject to the error. It becomes the responsibility of the programmer to translate help to their codebase. GitHub Copilot helps with this translation.<p>In other instances of explaining and fixing errors, GitHub Copilot would provide solutions that technically worked. These <strong>technically correct</strong> solutions fell into 3 buckets (in order of frequency):<ol><li>Solutions that were the “best” for the job. At least to my knowledge.<li>Solutions that were not the “best”, and I had to continue iterating before settling on a final implementation.<li>Solutions that were the “best” because they were <strong>better</strong> than my initial intentions.</ol><p>This experience did not completely replace <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM>RTFM</a> or web search. The challenge seems to be identifying and providing the proper context to GitHub Copilot to generate a helpful response. But, it has become my first line of defense against the <u class=red-squiggly>red underlines</u> in my IDE.<h2 id=repetitive-or-one-off-tasks>Repetitive or One-Off Tasks</h2><p>When it comes to actually generating code, I found GitHub Copilot to be particularly helpful in 2 places: very repetitive code and one-off tasks that might be done once per project.<h3 id=repetitive-code>Repetitive Code</h3><p>When developing software, I will almost religiously enforce <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself>DRY</a> principals. The one constant exception to this is when writing unit tests. This allows unit tests to serve as self-contained examples as well. And, debugging tests is easier without the extra layers of abstraction that reduce repeated code.<p>In addition to the repetitive nature, unit tests often have an explicit naming pattern. For example, test names might follow the template:<pre class="language-rust z-code" data-lang=rust><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust><span class="z-source z-rust"><span class="z-meta z-annotation z-rust"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-annotation z-rust">#</span><span class="z-punctuation z-section z-group z-begin z-rust">[</span><span class="z-variable z-annotation z-rust">test</span><span class="z-punctuation z-section z-group z-end z-rust">]</span></span>

</span></code></pre><p>The repetitive nature of unit tests and clear test naming creates perfect conditions for GitHub Copilot to generate large portions of code. In terms of pure time savings, I found this to be the most helpful use of GitHub Copilot.<h3 id=one-off-tasks>One-Off Tasks</h3><p>On the other end of the spectrum are one-off tasks. These are the tasks that happen infrequently enough that it is hard to become an “expert” in the syntax.<p>When building Dotpatina, I created GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment. This is a one-time set up task and requires specific yaml syntax.<p>A quick comment, and GitHub Copilot suggests the proper yaml for triggering a workflow under the desired conditions.<p><img alt="GitHub Actions autocomplete" src=/img/dotpatina/gh-actions.png><h2 id=my-concerns-with-ai-pair-programming>My Concerns with AI Pair Programming</h2><p>Generative AI and AI Pair Programming is here to stay, and I believe Software Engineers will need to make use of this technology (where it provides real benefit) in order to stay relevant in the job market.However, I do have some concerns with generative AI’s impact on the industry.<p>I worry about its ability to generate hidden <strong>technical debt</strong>, especially when code is not thoroughly reviewed by an expert. Even if code functions perfectly. Inefficient code is harder to maintain and makes less code less <a href=https://www.green-coding.io/>green</a>.<p>I worry about the <strong>accessibility</strong> of programming. Learning to code had been very accessible to people, only requiring a computer and an internet connection. While there are cheaper AI pair programmers and GitHub Copilot has a free tier, it is still expensive to get “quality and quantity” use out of AI pair programmers.<p>And, I worry that the <strong>craftsmanship</strong> of computer programming will lose value. Although admittedly, this one makes me sound like a horse in the age of the automobile.<h1 id=takeaways>Takeaways</h1><p>Taking the time to learn a new programming language and complete a full end-to-end project was a fun exercise. Putting an intentional effort into using an AI pair programmer in this context let me evaluate GitHub Copilot as a tool without the pressures of deadlines or scrutiny of others. And, this has given me motivation for starting or completing other side-projects to satisfy my desire to build Software outside the context of my day job.<p>Building on my new knowledge of Rust, I plan on exploring <a href=https://bevyengine.org/>game development with Bevy</a> or <a href=https://v2.tauri.app/>cross-platform app development with Tauri</a>. I am also interested in evaluating <a href=https://www.continue.dev/>Continue</a> with local <a href=https://ollama.com/>Ollama models</a> as a more accessible AI pair programmer alternative.</section><div class=comments data-category=Announcements data-category-id=DIC_kwDONvmBdc4CmW3h data-dark-theme=catppuccin_frappe data-input-position=bottom data-lang=en data-lazy-loading=true data-light-theme=catppuccin_latte data-mapping=specific data-reactions-enabled=1 data-repo=axis7818/axis7818.github.io data-repo-id=R_kgDONvmBdQ data-strict=1 data-term=learning-rust id=comments><script async src=https://camerontaylor.dev/js/giscus.min.js></script><noscript>You need JavaScript to view the comments.</noscript></div></article></main><div id=button-container><div id=toc-floating-container><input class=toggle id=toc-toggle type=checkbox><label title="Toggle Table of Contents" class=button for=toc-toggle id=toc-button><svg viewbox="0 -960 960 960" xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M414.82-193.094q-18.044 0-30.497-12.32-12.453-12.319-12.453-30.036t12.453-30.086q12.453-12.37 30.497-12.37h392.767q17.237 0 29.927 12.487 12.69 12.486 12.69 30.203 0 17.716-12.69 29.919t-29.927 12.203H414.82Zm0-244.833q-18.044 0-30.497-12.487Q371.87-462.9 371.87-480.45t12.453-29.92q12.453-12.369 30.497-12.369h392.767q17.237 0 29.927 12.511 12.69 12.512 12.69 29.845 0 17.716-12.69 30.086-12.69 12.37-29.927 12.37H414.82Zm0-245.167q-18.044 0-30.497-12.32t-12.453-30.037q0-17.716 12.453-30.086 12.453-12.369 30.497-12.369h392.767q17.237 0 29.927 12.486 12.69 12.487 12.69 30.203 0 17.717-12.69 29.92-12.69 12.203-29.927 12.203H414.82ZM189.379-156.681q-32.652 0-55.878-22.829t-23.226-55.731q0-32.549 23.15-55.647 23.151-23.097 55.95-23.097 32.799 0 55.313 23.484 22.515 23.484 22.515 56.246 0 32.212-22.861 54.893-22.861 22.681-54.963 22.681Zm0-245.167q-32.652 0-55.878-23.134-23.226-23.135-23.226-55.623 0-32.487 23.467-55.517t56.12-23.03q32.102 0 54.721 23.288 22.62 23.288 22.62 55.775 0 32.488-22.861 55.364-22.861 22.877-54.963 22.877Zm-.82-244.833q-32.224 0-55.254-23.288-23.03-23.289-23.03-55.623 0-32.333 23.271-55.364 23.272-23.03 55.495-23.03 32.224 0 55.193 23.288 22.969 23.289 22.969 55.622 0 32.334-23.21 55.364-23.21 23.031-55.434 23.031Z"/></svg></label><div class=toc-content><div class=toc-container><ul><li><a href=https://camerontaylor.dev/blog/learning-rust/#being-a-beginner-again>Being a Beginner Again</a> <ul><li><a href=https://camerontaylor.dev/blog/learning-rust/#beginner-rust-resources>Beginner Rust Resources</a><li><a href=https://camerontaylor.dev/blog/learning-rust/#the-rust-software-development-lifecycle>The Rust Software Development Lifecycle</a> <ul><li><a href=https://camerontaylor.dev/blog/learning-rust/#vscode-vs-rust-rover>VSCode vs Rust Rover</a></ul></ul><li><a href=https://camerontaylor.dev/blog/learning-rust/#learning-rust-with-ai-assistance>Learning Rust with AI Assistance</a> <ul><li><a href=https://camerontaylor.dev/blog/learning-rust/#explaining-errors>Explaining Errors</a><li><a href=https://camerontaylor.dev/blog/learning-rust/#repetitive-or-one-off-tasks>Repetitive or One-Off Tasks</a> <ul><li><a href=https://camerontaylor.dev/blog/learning-rust/#repetitive-code>Repetitive Code</a><li><a href=https://camerontaylor.dev/blog/learning-rust/#one-off-tasks>One-Off Tasks</a></ul><li><a href=https://camerontaylor.dev/blog/learning-rust/#my-concerns-with-ai-pair-programming>My Concerns with AI Pair Programming</a></ul><li><a href=https://camerontaylor.dev/blog/learning-rust/#takeaways>Takeaways</a></ul></div></div></div><a title="Go to the comments section" class=no-hover-padding href=#comments id=comments-button> <svg viewbox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor><path d="M18 10c0 3.866-3.582 7-8 7a8.841 8.841 0 01-4.083-.98L2 17l1.338-3.123C2.493 12.767 2 11.434 2 10c0-3.866 3.582-7 8-7s8 3.134 8 7zM7 9H5v2h2V9zm8 0h-2v2h2V9zM9 9h2v2H9V9z" clip-rule=evenodd fill-rule=evenodd /></svg> </a><a title="Go to the top of the page" class=no-hover-padding href=# id=top-button> <svg viewbox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor><path d="M3.293 9.707a1 1 0 010-1.414l6-6a1 1 0 011.414 0l6 6a1 1 0 01-1.414 1.414L11 5.414V17a1 1 0 11-2 0V5.414L4.707 9.707a1 1 0 01-1.414 0z"/></svg> </a></div><span class=hidden id=copy-success> Copied!
